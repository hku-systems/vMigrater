Fix Kernel's bug about idle thread.


Apply the patch to the pristine linux kernel 4.12.9 by:

cd linux-4.12.9

patch -p4 < ../patch_newidlethread.diff

Enable new idle thread by:

echo -n 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/cpuidle_busy_loop

Disable new idle thread by:

echo -n 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/cpuidle_busy_loop

This work is done by senior fellow apprentice, Jianchen Shan.
